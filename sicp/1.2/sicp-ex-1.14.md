Exercise 1.14: 
Draw the tree illustrating the process generated by the count-change procedure of 1.2.2 in making change for 11 cents.
What are the orders of growth of the space and number of steps used by this process as the amount to be changed increases?

From the book: 

In general, the number of steps required by a tree-recursive process will be proportional to the number of nodes in the tree, while the space required will be proportional to the maximum depth of the tree. 
Therefore the space complexity is O(n) and time O(n^k) which is O(n^5) for our method.
